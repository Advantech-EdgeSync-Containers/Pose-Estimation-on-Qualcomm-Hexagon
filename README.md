# Pose Estimation on Qualcomm® Hexagon™

**Version:** 1.0  
**Release Date:** Aug 2025  
**Copyright:** © 2025 Advantech Corporation. All rights reserved.

## Overview

The `Pose Estimation on Qualcomm® Hexagon™` container image provides a comprehensive environment for Pose Estimation model on Qualcomm’s DSP-enabled hardware. This containerized setup ensures full hardware acceleration, reliability, and support for popular runtime environments like QNN, SNPE, and LiteRT.
At the core of this project, **YOLOv8** and **HRNet Pose Estimation** is used as the pose estimation model. Two complementary workflows are supported:

1. **Ultralytics Export Workflow**  
   - An automated script directly leverages the **Ultralytics YOLOv8 export utilities**, producing model in TFlite format suitable to run on QCS6490 device utilizing Hexagon™ DSP.
   - Offers flexibility for quick prototyping and validation on the device.  
   - Ideal for iterative development/training where models may frequently change before being finalized.

2. **AI Hub Conversion Workflow**  
   - HRNet Pose Estimation Model is downloaded from Qualcomm’s Hugging Face Models repository via an automated script
   - This workflow ensures maximum utilization of the Hexagon™ DSP for INT8 inference acceleration.  
   - Best suited for quick deployments where optimized performance is critical.

By combining these two approaches, the project balances rapid prototyping & deployment with Ultralytics and Qualcomm® AI Hub, making it suitable for diverse edge AI applications such as robotics, industrial vision, and smart surveillance etc.

## Options for Exporting & Running Pose models on QCS6490

### Option 1 - Ultralytics Export Workflow: 

#### Export YOLOv8 Models via Local Script

Use the export script inside the container to convert and quantize YOLOv8 models to `.tflite`.

[YOLO Export Instructions](./YOLO_EXPORT_README.md)

#### Run YOLO‑Exported Model (CLI)

> **Camera Setup Note:** If you want to run this container for camera feed, ensure the camera is connected to the edge device before running ./build.sh or starting the container. Verify camera detection using the following command:
```bash
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```

Use the following command to run inference with your exported model:

```bash
python3 advantech-yolo.py --model=<MODEL_PATH> --source=<VIDEO_SOURCE> [--cam-width=<INT>] [--cam-height=<INT>] [--conf-thres=<FLOAT>] [--iou-thres=<FLOAT>] [--save=<OUTPUT_PATH>]
```

Here’s what each field represents:
* **`--model`**
  *Required.* Path to the TFLite YOLOv8 model used for inference (e.g., `model/yolov8n-pose_pose.tflite`).

* **`--source`**
  *Optional (default: `/etc/media/video.mp4`).* Can be:

  * A video file path (e.g., `video/pose_1080p_25fps.mp4`)
  * A device file for webcam input (e.g., `/dev/video0`)
  * An RTSP video stream (e.g., `rtsp://13.232.142.213:8554/mystream`)

* **`--cam-width`**
  *Optional** (default: `1920`).* Applicable **only when `--source` is a webcam device**. Sets the webcam's capture width.

* **`--cam-height`**
  *Optional** (default: `1080`).* Applicable **only when `--source` is a webcam device**. Sets the webcam's capture height.

* **`--conf-thres`**
  *Optional (default: `0.5`).* Confidence threshold to filter out low-confidence detections (value between 0 and 1).

* **`--iou-thres`**
  *Optional (default: `0.5`).* Intersection-over-Union threshold governing Non-Maximum Suppression, removing overlapping detections.
 
* **`--save`**
  *Optional.* File path to save the annotated inference output as an MP4 video. The footage will still be displayed live via GStreamer.

##### Example Commands

* **Run detection on a video file:**

  ```bash
  python3 advantech-yolo.py --model=model/yolov8n-pose_pose.tflite --source=video/pose_1080p_25fps.mp4
  ```
* **Run detection via discover (e.g. `discover`):**

  ```bash
  python3 advantech-yolo.py --model=model/yolov8n-pose_pose.tflite --source=discover
  ```
* **Run Pose Estimation via webcam (e.g. `/dev/video0`):**

  ```bash
  python3 advantech-yolo.py --model=model/yolov8n-pose_pose.tflite --source=/dev/video0 --cam-width=1920 --cam-height=1080
  ```
* **Display and Save to MP4 File:**
  ```bash
  python3 advantech-yolo.py --model=model/yolov8n-pose_pose.tflite --source=video/pose_1080p_25fps.mp4 --save=output.mp4
  ```

### Option 2 - AI Hub Conversion Workflow: 

#### Export HRNet Pose Model from Qualcomm® AI Hub

For pulling models from Qualcomm’s cloud-based hub using an API token.

[AI Hub Export Instructions](./AI_HUB_EXPORT_README.md)

#### Run AI Hub–Exported Model (GStreamer Application)

Customize the AI pose estimation application by editing the configuration file at `/etc/configs/config_pose.json`. This file defines the model, labels, runtime, and other essential settings.

---
##### Configure the Pose Estimation Application

You must edit the configuration file located at `/etc/configs/config_pose.json`. Here’s how to do it using `vi`, the standard command-line editor:

**1. Open the file in `vi`:**

```sh
vi /etc/configs/config_pose.json
```

If the file does not exist, `vi` will create one for you.

**2. Basic `vi` usage:**

* You start in **command mode**. To enter **insert mode**, press `i`.
* After editing, press `Esc` to go back to command mode.

**3. Save and exit:**

* Save and quit: Type `:wq` and press Enter
* Or simply `ZZ` (both uppercase)
* Exit without saving: Type `:q!` and press Enter

**4. Vi quick reference:**

| Command | Action                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `i`     | Enter insert mode (type text) |
| `Esc`   | Return to command mode        |
| `:wq`   | Save and exit `vi`            |
| `ZZ`    | Save and exit (alternate)     |
| `:q!`   | Exit without saving           |

---

##### General Configuration Template

```bash
{
  "file-path": "<input video path>",
  "ml-framework": "<snpe, tflite, or qnn>",
  "model": "<Model Path>",
  "labels": "<Label Path>",
  "constants": "<Model Constants for LiteRT Model>",
  "threshold": <Post‑processing threshold, integer from 1–100>,
  "runtime": "<dsp, cpu, or gpu>"
}
```

Here’s what each field represents:

* Use **either `file-path`** (for video input) **or `camera`** (for live camera stream), not both.
	* `"file-path"`: Source of input video, e.g., `/etc/media/video.mp4`.
	* `"camera": 0` → Primary camera
	* `"camera": 1` → Secondary camera
* `ml-framework`: Runtime framework—choose one of `snpe`, `tflite`, or `qnn`.
* `model`: Full path to the `.tflite` or `.dlc` model.
* `labels`: Label file path mapping detection classes.
* `constants`: Quantization metadata in the format:

  ```
  hrnet,q-offsets=<8.0>,q-scales=<0.0040499246679246426>;
  ```

  Derived from your model’s quantization parameters.
* `threshold`: Confidence cutoff for pose estimation.
* `runtime`: Preferred inference engine—`dsp` (recommended for edge), `cpu`, or `gpu`.

---

##### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "file-path": "/etc/media/video.mp4",
  "ml-framework": "tflite",
  "model": "/etc/models/hrnet_pose.tflite",
  "labels": "/etc/labels/hrnet_pose.labels",
  "constants": "hrnet,q-offsets=<8.0>,q-scales=<0.0040499246679246426>;",
  "threshold": 51,
  "runtime": "dsp"
}

```

This configuration:

* Uses a TFLite-format HRNET POSE model running on the DSP.
* Sets Pose Estimation threshold to 51%.
* Points to local paths for media, model, and labels.

---

##### Execute the Pose Estimation Application

After saving your changes:

```bash
gst-ai-pose-detection --config-file=/etc/configs/config_pose.json
```

You'll see the input video annotated in real time—displayed with bounding boxes and pose skeleton around detected objects, based on your configuration.

---

#### Important Note: Format & Resolution Support

* This GStreamer-based Pose Estimation workflow **only supports MP4 and MOV input formats** and is reliably tested at **1080p resolution (1920×1080)**. Using lower resolutions (e.g., 720p or below) may result in misaligned detection boxes and pose skeleton due to scaling and aspect ratio handling issues with the video sink.
* In the camera mode, **gst-ai-pose-detection** relies on the **qtiqmmfsrc** GStreamer plugin, which is designed to interface with **MIPI‑CSI** connected cameras only. USB webcams are not supported. [Qualcomm® Camera Overview](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70020-17/camera-overview.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&version=1.5&facet=Camera)

## Recommendation – Pose Estimation by Content Type

Pose estimation performance can vary with video characteristics. For videos with clear full-body visibility (e.g., outdoor dance, sports etc.), **YOLOv8n-pose** often provides stable results with lower compute overhead. However, for more complex cases such as indoor yoga, low-light conditions, or poses with floor contact and occlusion, it is recommended to use higher-capacity models like **YOLOv8s** or **YOLOv8m** to achieve better accuracy and stability.

Contributing factors include:
- **Lighting & contrast:** Low or uneven indoor lighting reduces keypoint confidence.  
- **Motion blur:** Fast transitions or slow shutter speeds cause jitter and limb swaps.  
- **Viewpoint & foreshortening:** Extreme camera angles or floor-contact poses hide joints.  
- **Occlusion & self-occlusion:** Crossed limbs or body positions floor/ground occlude landmarks.  
- **Subject scale in frame:** Distant subjects or cropped frames reduce joint resolution.  
- **Background/clothing:** Similar tones between clothing and background confuse detection.  
- **Compression & frame rate:** High compression or frame rates below 25 fps introduce artifacts.  

## Known Limitations

* **LiteRT Runtime:** Limited DSP acceleration support for complex operators.
* **Model Batch Size:** Fixed batch size is required for models targeting DSP acceleration.
* **GStreamer Debug Level:**
   Using `GST_DEBUG=2` or higher may cause the video output to appear in **random positions on screen** or behave unexpectedly.
   Use `GST_DEBUG=0` or `GST_DEBUG=1` for stable video playback.
* **Resolution-Dependent Alignment Issues**: Option 2 is optimized for resolutions at or above **1080p**. **Below 1080p**, detection boxes and pose skeleton may appear **misaligned** with objects due to scaling artifacts and coordinate rounding.
